# 🖱️ Advertisement Click Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on their behavior and attributes.

## 📌 Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of online advertising, businesses aim to target users who are more likely to engage with ads. This project uses classification algorithms to predict ad click behavior using user data.

## 🧠 Model Overview
- **Algorithms Used**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- **Best Accuracy Achieved**: 94.3%
- **Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle (contains features like daily time spent on site, age, income, etc.)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualized correlations and distributions
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trained models using Logistic Regression & Decision Tree
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Results
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: ~93.5%
- **Decision Tree Accuracy**: **94.3%**

📌 Future Improvements
- Try ensemble models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
